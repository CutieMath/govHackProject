1,Narrowly align GPT-3,We don't know whether AI could actually be much worse than we think it is. This task looks into whether we can narrowly align GPT-3 to provide the best medical advice that it can,86
2,Implement Logical Induction,Logical Induction is a framework using markets to attempt to represent logical belief. Attempt to formalise this within a computer implementation.,7
3,Solve Protein Folding with AI,"Protein Folding is hard, but AI is really good at solving Hard problems. Us at deepmind need really clever people to help us with this task.",1
4,Collect better data on Mental Health within developing countries,"There isn't any good data on Mental Health in Developing Countries, please help us collect it!",58
5,List alternative food sources if the sun gets blotted out,"If a catastophe occurs, we need to make sure that everyone is fed. ALLFED looks into ways that we can feed the earth in disasters. You can help contribute to this research.",15
6,What would encourage people to eat plant based meat?,Plant and cell based meat are becoming cheaper and more ethical ways to feed people. This opportunity looks into ways that we can encourage more consumption of plant based meats.,21
7,Create processes for improving data collection of health interventions,"If we better utilized people within medical industry, we could do continuous trials on experimental interventions, and therefore get more medical knowledge faster. This looks into ways we can implement this.",85
8,Create tools to improve pandemic preparedness,We don't want another COVID-19. One way to prevent this is cost effective ways of screening people continously for infectious and unknown viruses.,69
9,Apply Microscope to better understand AI systems in CNNs,We don't know what happens inside CNNs. We wish to use Microscope to help improve the way that we understand a variety of classifications.,25
10,Help with the hiring of people within MIRI,"MIRI is an important orginazation, but it's difficult to scale. We need help in hiring and improving organizational efficiency",84
11,Quantitavely combine evidence on the value of the long term future,"We don't know how valuable the long term future is, or even how uncertain we are about it. We would like a distribution of uncertainty about this value.",16
12,Quantitatively compare different intervention options among different cause areas,"We have good comparisons between interventions in Global Health, but not between Global Health and other areas.",47
13,Put confidence bounds on the quantitative analysis done by GiveWell for global poverty,"We have estimates for what the value of global poverty interventions are, but not their uncertainy. Model uncertainty of GiveWell models",88
14,Create a central directory of open research questions within EA,"We have a lot of different research questions, but not in one place. Help by putting them in one place",12
15,Evaluate ways of improving air quality within South East Asia,Improving air quality in south east Asia could seriously improve wellbeing. We want to know too much.,19
16,Improve and scale the capabilities of Our World In Data's content management system,Our World in Data wants to expand and needs better infrastructure in its content management system,12

# Matchy Matchy for GovHack 2021

Matchy Matchy is a web based app made to take data from the [Australian Skills Classification](https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/our-work/australian-skills-classification) to link people up to projects that they can do with their self quantified skills and experience to Projects to help Australia in the future. The Webpage is built in [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) using Typescript and [d3js](https://d3js.org).

This app was created by [Authors](Authors) for the [GovHack 2021](https://govhack.org/).

# Matchy Matchy for GovHack 2021

Matchy Matchy is a web based platform to help users find where their skills can be used to help solve the [world’s most pressing problems](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). The platform only requires you simply input your competences and previous jobs, and using data from the [Australian Skills Classification](https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/our-work/australian-skills-classification), matches you up with potential projects where your skills could make a difference. Using Matchy Matchy you can devote more of their time into working on projects that need your skills to make the world a better place.

People want to do more good for others, and to do this, people have identified and created collections of the [world’s most pressing problems](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus). Including [databases of the most impactful research projects](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MsNpJBzv5YhdfNHc9/a-central-directory-for-open-research-questions) and [top priority jobs that need to be filled](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#best-opportunities).
Deciding which of these many highly pressing projects are a good fit for the individual has been a [pressing and largely unsolved problem](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/fSmBYeTyisyM9fkmD). Possible options have been done to improve the space including offering [personal career advice](https://80000hours.org/). However this doesn’t offer a platform where people can put their projects in a centralized way. This very application has been called for in proposals for [prize platforms](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Jsd5EGKCRnSspxEB8/a-proposal-for-a-small-inducement-prize-platform) and [centralized databases](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/fSmBYeTyisyM9fkmD/p/MxXQ2bbL6KPrHDPtz) and prototypes for [project boards](https://www.notion.so/EA-CoLabs-4ad54ee9ecd44e759f1d56caa4bdf56a). However, nothing stands out to meet this goal of these proposals, a place where the most pressing projects can be searched.
This project fills in the gap that has been called for, and helps better allocate people to not only jobs that they would be good at, but jobs where they are needed and will have an outsized impact.
